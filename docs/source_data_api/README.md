## Source Data API

The Source Data API provides an interface to the Collection and Retrieval microservices. The Collection service provides functions to push individual or batches of raw messages from many data sources that is aggregated in to a searchable stream. The Retrieval service provides functions to search for individual or batches of messages using the indexed portion of the stream generated by the Collection service. None of the services within the Source Data API read or modify the raw source data provided
